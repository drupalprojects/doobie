Existing tags
*************

Entire features or individual scenarios can be tagged as follows to assist in running tests:

Tags to assist in selectively running tests
===========================================

@ci
    Used to include a feature or scenario in the Drupal.org continuous integration system. Do NOT add this tag unless the feature/scenario in question has been proposed for inclusion in the issue queue and accepted.

@dependent
    Used to indicate a scenario that is dependent on data created previously in the same feature file. In a perfect world, scenarios like this would not exist, and the tag will help us isolate the scenarios if/when we come up with a better solution. Scenarios should *never* depend on data from a different feature file.

@flakey
    Currently used to mark tests which are pretty consistently failing on the first run and succeeding on all subsequent runs. Once #1782612: Tests failing on first run and succeeding on subsequent runs is resolved, use of this tag is deprecated.

@javascript
    Used when the feature being tested relies on CSS or javascript and must use a fully-featured browser for accurate testing. Note: Selenium must be running on the system executing tests or these scenarios will fail.

@known_git6failure
    Used when properly written tests fail against the D6 version of Drupal.org because that site is not behaving as expected.

@known_git7failure
    Used when properly written tests fail against the D7 version of Drupal.org because that site is not behaving as expected.

@linux
    Used to tag scenarios that depend on a properly-setup linux based system. Use of this tag needs to be re-evaluated. #1782628: Re-evaluate @linux tag
@slow
    Used for scenarios that are, well, slow. There is not, as yet, a definitive metric like, requires more than 10 seconds to complete.

@wip
    Used to tag a work-in-progress. These are typically excluded from a test run as they may fail or do not yet fully test the feature described.

Tags to hook into the test process
==================================

Certain tags are used to hook into the testing process to trigger activity. For example, a scenario that creates a node might be tagged with @cleanData will attempt to delete a node or project created by one of its steps. See http://docs.behat.org/guides/3.hooks.html for a detailed discussion of how this works in behat.

@cleanData
    Can be used to delete a project or issue node created as part of testing.
@gitrepo
    Indicates a scenario that creates a git repository and used to invoke an @AfterScenario clean up routine.

See http://docs.behat.org/guides/3.hooks.html for a detailed discussion.

Introducing new tags
********************
Any new tags that are committed to the repository should be documented both here and in the project's TAGS.txt file. If in doubt about whether or how to introduce a new tag, open an issue at http://drupal.org/project/doobie
