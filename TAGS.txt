Existing tags
*************

Entire features or individual scenarios can be tagged as follows to assist in running tests:

Tags to assist in selectively running tests
===========================================

@ci
    Used to include a feature or scenario in the Drupal.org continuous integration system. Do NOT add this tag unless the feature/scenario in question has been proposed for inclusion in the issue queue and accepted.

@smoke
    Used to include a feature or scenario in the smoke tests run by Drupal.org's continuous integration system after every commit. Do NOT add this tag unless the feature/scenario in question has been proposed for inclusion in the issue queue and accepted.

@dependent
    Used to indicate a scenario that is dependent on data created previously in the same feature file. In a perfect world, scenarios like this would not exist, and the tag will help us isolate the scenarios if/when we come up with a better solution. Scenarios should *never* depend on data from a different feature file.

@flaky
    Currently used to mark tests which are pretty consistently failing on the first run and succeeding on all subsequent runs. Once #1782612: Tests failing on first run and succeeding on subsequent runs is resolved, use of this tag is deprecated.

@javascript
    Used when the feature being tested relies on CSS or javascript and must use a fully-featured browser for accurate testing. Note: Selenium must be running on the system executing tests or these scenarios will fail.

@linux
    Used to tag scenarios that depend on a properly-setup linux based system. Use of this tag needs to be re-evaluated. #1782628: Re-evaluate @linux tag

@slow
    Used for scenarios that are, well, slow. There is not, as yet, a definitive metric like, requires more than 10 seconds to complete.

@wip
    Used to tag a work-in-progress. These are typically excluded from a test run as they may fail or do not yet fully test the feature described.

@anon
    Used for scenarios/features that don't require user authentication to run the test.

@htaccess (*)
    Denotes tests that currently cause re-authentication due to htaccss and require manual user input. bddtest.drupal.org is whitelisted to allow these tests to pass when run from that host.

@specific_text
    Denotes tests that are looking at text that is more likely to change and require update.

@timeout
    Tests that are likely to timeout, currently at 30 seconds.

Section Tags:

The tags below are used to identify where a feature (not an individual scenario) is located within the site map. These should be the first tag on the left above the feature description.

Featureset Tags
===============
Featureset tags describe features that don't correspond to a traditional site map structure or are complex features at a lower level on the site.

Tags to hook into the test process
==================================

Certain tags are used to hook into the testing process to trigger activity. For example, a scenario that creates a node might be tagged with @cleanData will attempt to delete a node or project created by one of its steps. See http://docs.behat.org/guides/3.hooks.html for a detailed discussion of how this works in behat. None of this is implemented.

@clean_data
    Can be used to delete a project or issue node created as part of testing.

@gitrepo
    Indicates a scenario that creates a git repository and used to invoke an @AfterScenario clean up routine.

@git_branch
    Indicates a scenario that creates a branch in the git repository and used to invoke an @AfterScenario clean up routine.

@git_tag (*)
    Indicates a scenario that creates a tag in the git repository and used to invoke an @AfterScenario clean up routine.

See http://docs.behat.org/guides/3.hooks.html for a detailed discussion.

Introducing new tags
********************
Any new tags that are committed to the repository should be documented both here and in the project's TAGS.txt file. If in doubt about whether or how to introduce a new tag, open an issue at http://drupal.org/project/doobie

---------------
Previously undocumented tags
These tags are either misused, unnecessary or need to be documented.

@api - causes the drupal extension to use the configured 'drupal api' which is most likely drush.
@cache - This is a scenario that flushes the cache.
@drush - not sure. only in the drupal extension.

@content - tests marked content are tests that look for text that is easily changed by end users.
@prod_only - tests that only work on production? (uses solr) - just one.

@changerecords - tests change record scenarios
@drupal-services - one feature that tests the /drupal-services drupal service provider
@issues - scenarios that test the issue tracking functionality of project module
@maintainers - adding and removing maintainers from a project
@manual - maybe issues that needed to be run manually?
@other - scenarios and features that are not on a subsection of the site?
@profile - User profile features
@sandbox - Scenarios for validating that sandboxes work properly
@search - Features and scenarios that cover the Search aspects of drupal.org
@spam - Scenarios that exercise spam efforts
@releases - Features + Scenarios to test packaging releases, and downloading releases.
@whitelist - tests the packaging whitelist features for drupal.org
@failing - tests that are failing due to interdependencies or possibly user role expectations.

@local - ??
@needs_data - ??
@notification - ??
